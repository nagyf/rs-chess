Chess engine implementation in Rust.

This is a **work-in-progress** project, there are no working examples yet.

## Getting started

First, you need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your computer, please check out the official documentation.

## Contributing

Please read the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Versioning

I prefer [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Check out the link for more information, the most important part is:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
```
